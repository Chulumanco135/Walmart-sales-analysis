# Project Topic
•	Sales Comparison and Performance Analysis Across Walmart Stores Using Weekly Sales Data.

# Background 
•	Many retail businesses operate in a challenging environment where the sale performances are influenced by various external and internal factors. Walmart as one of the biggest retail stores globally, collects data from different stores to understand trend, customer behavior and improve the decision-making. Sales can fluctuate based on seasonality, promotional events, regional differences, and economic indicators such as fuel prices, consumer price index (CPI), and unemployment rates. Analyzing this data helps uncover patterns and supports strategic planning.

# Problem statement 
•	Although Walmart store collects data every week but it does not clarify on which stores are underperforming or which factors (external or internal factors) influences their sales most. Without deeper analysis of the store sales the business opportunities and areas where there are issues may go unnoticed.

# Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to:
•	Compare weekly sales across different Walmart stores.
•	Analyze how sales are influenced by holidays and economic conditions.
•	Identify top-performing and underperforming stores.
•	Visualize patterns in sales over time and during special periods.
# Research Questions
•	Which Walmart stores perform best in terms of weekly sales?
•	Do holidays significantly impact weekly sales?
•	How do economic factors like fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment relate to sales performance?
•	Are there seasonal trends or anomalies in sales data?
# Aim 
•	This study focuses on sales data collected from multiple Walmart stores across different weeks. It covers sales trends, store comparisons, holiday effects, and economic influences using variables available in the dataset.
Significance of the Study
Understanding how various factors influence sales can help Walmart and other retailers:
•	Improve sales strategies across different regions.
•	Prepare better for holiday periods and economic fluctuations.
•	Optimize performance across branches based on data-driven insights.
